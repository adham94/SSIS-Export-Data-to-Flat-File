# SSIS-Export-Data-to-Flat-File
build a SSIS package that will query a SQL server table and export  the data into a flat file. You can choose where it is delivered or what directory and automate the naming of the file with a date format.   You can schedule this via SQL Job Agent for automated delivery of flat files to your customer or you can run it using DTEXEC.EXE Command Line Utility.
